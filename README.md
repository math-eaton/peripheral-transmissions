# peripheral-transmissions
is a geographic radio receiver

the browser-based tuner will enable the user to survey an audio landscape constructed by internet radio “transmissions” related to particular geographic coordinates. the interpolated spaces between these discrete points create alternative boundary regions constructed by radio and its attendant cultural affinities, rather than the (often violently drawn) lines found on a political map


todo: 

updated placeholder audio with scraped samples
add unity mixdown
add audio crossfade behavior, proximity to buffer centroid
temporal component? alternative linear space @ time zones
