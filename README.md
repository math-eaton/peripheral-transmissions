# peripheral transmissions
is a geographic radio receiver

the browser-based tuner will enable the user to survey an audio landscape constructed by internet radio “transmissions” related to particular geographic coordinates. the interpolated spaces between these discrete points create alternative boundary regions constructed by radio and its attendant cultural affinities, rather than the (often violently drawn) lines found on a political map
